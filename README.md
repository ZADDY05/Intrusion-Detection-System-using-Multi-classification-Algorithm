# Intrusion-Detection-System-using-Multi-classification-Algorithm

## Introduction:

In the present modern world, information are transferred through network. Cyber Attacks on Network significantly threatens the data privacy of an individual as well as organizations worldwide. As cyber threats continue to evolve, traditional security systems seems to be lacking to detect and mitigate new network attacks and these attacks are evolving rapidly. This project presents a An AI-Based Multi-Class Classification Approach for Detecting and Categorizing Complex Network Attacks in High-Dimensional Traffic Using CICIDS2017, capable of identifying and categorizing modern network threats with high accuracy. The project begins with exploring dataset and the dataset that utilized in the project is CICIDS 2017 dataset which contains 79 features with a label feature indicating the attack type. The dataset contains some empty values which will be removed by using dropna() function in the data preprocessing part. The dataset contains various classes of attacks and there are some imbalance in the class, so we used SMOTE to oversample the dataset which makes the dataset to have equal amount of class distribution. we implement multiple classification algorithms—including XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear SVC, Naïve Bayes, D-Tree, and LightGBM to analyze and categorize normal it is. We analysed how efficiently these models detects attacks based on how Accurate , Precise, recall, F1-score, and computational efficiency to determine the most effective approach for threat detection. We used cross validation method which is Stratified K-Fold method which is used to make sure our models don’t overfit and underfit during the training process. After training and testing the models, we used Matplot function to visualize the scores, confusion matrix, learning curve of the models. In order to make our project more efficient we used Undersampler to our dataset and also compared it with our main model. The results of our project shows a great accuracy in detecting the Intrusion with the accuracy score of 99.89% for our Rf-GBM Algorithm .We found the potential of machine learning in adding some value to the cybersecurity domain, By providing an adaptive and adequate solution to counteract emerging network threats. This project enhances the development of intelligent Intrusion Detection System frameworks that can strengthen cybersecurity defences in modern network infrastructures.
